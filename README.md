# BURGER APP

## Developed by Jaime Arriola

- Situation: There are companies who wants a very visual experiencie on their applications and food industry is one of them, if you want to order food it would be great to build your own burger or pizza and then checkout your order and wait it.

- Action: I developed this application following a tutorial but at same time I added my personal stamp by adding some customized styles.

- Result: The outcome is this great application which is using a firebase backend as data base and also it's doing authentication and also uses guardians to just allow you make an order if are previously log in in the application.
